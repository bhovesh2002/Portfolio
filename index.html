            <h3>Tic Tac Toe </h3>
            <p>A simple  tic tac toe game which can be played against a CPU enemy, the user can decide if they want to choose O or X.</p>
            <h3>E-com site structure</h3>
            <p>
                Structure of an ecom site, created using java, where somebody can register as a seller to sell their product and another person can register
                as user to buy products. The program keeps a realtime count of the products and thier quantity gets changed as they get
                purchased or added more of them. While it is not a fully functionable ecom site, it helped me understand its basic structure.
            </p>
            <h3>Music Player Program</h3>
            <p>
                A music player program using java, where you can add new songs and play them. thry can switch to next song or play a playlist
                on random and songs get changed seemlessly after one song gets completed. This might not be a functionable music player app, 
                it taught me how a music player works in the background and how things get handled overall.

            <h3>Future Focus(November 2023)</h3>
            <p>
                In here I created a whatsapp bot which sends data to backend, created using Java Spring boot, and a website using 
                Thymeleaf to show the collected data. A person has to first register and login and then they can see the collected data.
                The user can search a specific data entry using various parameters. The user can also bulk load data in the 
                mysql database using an excel file. The site also is currently deployed using AWS rds and ec2.
